# Ideation

_To understand why you're building the project_

The purpose of this project is to build a web app for both personal and group expense tracking, and to learn how to use Codex (coding agents) to build full stack apps.

**Pain point**: Ther are separate apps for personal finance tracking and group finance tracking, however, ther's a lack of a unified platform.

## Solution

- A unified app which provides a single unified platform to keep track of all your expenses personal and group.
- Track category-wise and time-wise (weekly/monthly) expenses.
